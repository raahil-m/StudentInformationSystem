# StudentInformationSystem

Title of the project: Student Information System 

Problem Description: We all know how frustrating is to get around McMaster Mosaic, and to just know one simple thing, it is atleast 5-6 click away. So I have created a University Student Information System which shows record of the student (info, grades, courses). This info can be displayed, modified, searched and recorded. The student will also be able to see the courses that are needed for them to graduate, and also they can swap and change courses which the program will show the timing of the open courses. 

C++ concept being used:

-functions (Create a function that will calculate the students current gpa and final gpa in their courses. Create a function that will calculate the final grade needed for the student to attain their inputted final grade goal.)
-classes (There will be 3 classes used in the program. First one will be student class, second being a course class, and third being a courses needed for graduation class)
-pointers (pointers will be used to link all the void and major classes to the sub classes)
-infile/outfile (Will be needed to identify the student information like password entry and student identification. Also will be used for letting the user know their courses need for graduation after they have entered the courses they currently have and taken in the past.)  
-overload functions 
-constructors 
-inheritance (more internal classes will be entered in the major classes to get inheritance)
